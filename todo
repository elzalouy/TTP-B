TODO  deleteTaskFromBoard, editTaskFromBoard createTaskFromBoard emit

Status : Not Started

Issue : When we edit a certain task from ttp , we need to emit the task changes to all open sockets.

TODO edit task info with attachment

Status : Done, Tested

Issue : Every attachment we will upload will call the webhookUpdate with addAttachmentToCard type, 
and every attachment is gonna be deleted will call the webhookUpdate with deleteAttachmentFromCard.
So
1- deleting an attachment will delete the attachment from trello not the db and trello will call a webhook to update us.
2- creating an attachment will create the attachment on trello not our db and then trello will update us with the new one.

TODO socket filter issue 

Status : Done, Testing

Issue : delete the filter of the sockets.

TODO send notification to all OMs if a project is created by a PM
Status : Done, Testing

TODO moveTask socket

Status : InProgress

Issue : moveTask should send a notification to the project manager, if he wasn't the one who moved this task. Move task from trello doesn't allow me to know who moved it. so i am not gonna send a notification if task has been moved from trello.
